# Steps in Schools::RegisterMentorWizard will have a Schools::RegisterMentor::Mentor instance
# available rather than the wizard store directly.
# The aim of this class is to encapsulate and provide Mentor logic instead of spreading it across the various steps.
#
# This class will depend so much on the multiple data saved in the wizard.store by the steps during the journey
# that has been built on top of it by inheriting from Ruby SimpleDelegator class.
